# Kruskal-MST
Kruskal Algorithm Minimum Spanning Tree 

This is minimum spanning tree program for determine shortpath from graph using Kruskal Algorithm with Java

There are 4 classes in this program :

1. Edge class : this class representage the edge from a graph
2. graph class : this class representage the graph that user use for searching shortpath
3. kruskal class : this class representage kruskal algorithm
4. graphApp class : this class is used for testing the program
